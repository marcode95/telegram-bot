## Getting Started

**Step 1**<br>
Clone the repo to a local folder by inputting this command into your terminal<br>
`git clone https://github.com/marcode95/telegram-bot`<br>
and switch to the feature branch with this one<br>
`git checkout feature`<br>
**Step 2**<br>
Run `cd telegram-bot`<br>
**Step 3**<br>
Run `bundle install` to install the gems from the `Gemfile`.<br>
**Step 4**<br>
Download the [Telegram app](https://desktop.telegram.org/), create an account, search for a new contact named [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather).<br>
**Step 5**<br>
Press /start to start the conversation and /newbot to create a new bot (just follow the instructions). You will then receive an API Token that looks like this: 1347431199:AAH4hPt6PDiJB4swk23Lb4oOzwocjKpba0S4<br>
**Step 6**<br>
Go to lib/bot.rb, put your token into quotation marks to turn it into a string and replace Token.new.token in line 14 with it. Line 14 should look something like this afterwards:  token = '1347431199:AAH4hPt6PDiJB4swk23Lb4oOzwocjKpba0S4'<br>
**Step 7**<br>
Delete line 5 "require_relative '../config.rb'<br>
**Step 8**<br>
Run `ruby ./bin/main.rb` to start the bot.<br>
**Step 9**<br>
After creating your bot in telegram Botfather should have provided you with a link to access it. Press it.<br>
**Step 10**<br>
Type /hey to start and enjoy!
